# My DSA Journey with JavaScript (DSA-with-JS)

This repository documents my exploration of data structures and algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript. It serves as a personal playground to learn, experiment, and implement various DSA concepts. 

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you set up to contribute to this project.

#### Prerequisites

You'll need the following things installed on your system:

* Node.js and npm (or yarn): [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrshnK/DSA-with-JS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DSA-with-JS
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Data Structures (DSA Topics)

Here's a list of common DSA topics covered (or potentially covered) in this repository:

* **Arrays:** Basic operations, searching, sorting, manipulation
* **Linked Lists:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, operations
* **Stacks:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, implementation, applications
* **Queues:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, implementation, applications
* **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), operations, traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
* **Hash Tables:** Key-value pair storage, collision resolution techniques
* **Graphs:**  Adjacency list, adjacency matrix representation, graph traversals (BFS, DFS)
* **Heaps:** Min-heaps, max-heaps, implementation, applications (priority queues)
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort (time and space complexities)
* **Searching Algorithms:** Linear search, binary search (for sorted arrays)
* **Recursion:** Understanding recursive functions, common problems solved with recursion
